This is an <iframe> webpage plugin for the participants leaderboard. It is highkey trash and uses manual updation using Firebase.

If you're reading this, I don't like you. In my defense, the BetaTest app failed because of some server glitch and I had to write this iFrame embed in 10 minutes. Go kill yourself

Please never use such softwares, it is a disgrace to the tech society.
